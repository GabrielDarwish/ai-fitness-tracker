# üìö Exercise Library Setup Guide

## Overview
The Exercise Library allows users to browse 1300+ exercises from ExerciseDB, filter them by body part, equipment, and target muscle, and save their favorites.

**‚ú® NEW: Auto-Sync Feature** - Exercises are **automatically cached** when a user first visits the library. No manual setup required!

---

## üîë Prerequisites

1. **ExerciseDB API Key** ‚ö†Ô∏è **REQUIRED**
   - Sign up at [RapidAPI ExerciseDB](https://rapidapi.com/justin-WFnsXH_t6/api/exercisedb)
   - Get your API key
   - Add it to your `.env` file:
     ```env
     EXERCISEDB_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
     ```
   - **That's it!** The rest is automatic.

## üöÄ How It Works

### Automatic Sync on First Visit

When any user visits `/library` for the first time:

1. **Auto-check**: The app checks if exercises exist in the database
2. **Auto-sync**: If empty, it automatically fetches all 1300+ exercises from ExerciseDB
3. **Progress UI**: User sees a nice loading screen with progress indicator
4. **One-time only**: Exercises are cached forever, no re-sync needed
5. **Zero manual work**: Everything happens automatically!

### First Visit Experience

User sees:
```
üí™ (animated)
Loading Exercise Library...
First time setup - caching 1300+ exercises from ExerciseDB
[Progress bar]
This may take 30-60 seconds...
```

### Subsequent Visits

After the first sync:
- Instant load - exercises are cached in your database
- No API calls to ExerciseDB (rate-limit friendly!)
- Normal browsing experience

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Error Handling

If the ExerciseDB API key is missing, users will see:

```
‚ö†Ô∏è
Setup Required
ExerciseDB API key not configured. Please add EXERCISEDB_API_KEY to your .env file.

[Retry button]
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Manual Sync (Optional)

If you want to manually trigger a sync (e.g., to update exercise data):

If you need to re-sync all exercises (e.g., ExerciseDB updated their data):

1. Delete all exercises from the database:
   ```bash
   npx prisma studio
   # Open Exercise table and delete all records
   ```

2. Visit `/library` again - auto-sync will trigger

**Option B: Using the Manual Sync Endpoint**

For admin use only (force sync even if exercises exist):

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/exercises/sync
```

This will upsert all exercises (update existing, create new ones).

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### "No exercises found"
- Make sure you've run the sync endpoint or seed script
- Check that `EXERCISEDB_API_KEY` is set in `.env`
- Verify exercises exist in the database:
  ```bash
  npx prisma studio
  # Check the Exercise table
  ```

### "Failed to fetch exercises"
- Check browser console for errors
- Ensure you're authenticated
- Verify database connection

### ExerciseDB API rate limits

## üöÄ Next Steps

The Exercise Library is the foundation for:
- **Custom Workout Builder** - Add saved exercises to workout templates
- **AI Workout Generator** - AI can reference the exercise library
- **Workout Logging** - Log sets/reps for exercises
- **Progress Tracking** - Track PRs for specific exercises

## üí° Tips

1. **Sync once during deployment** - Don't sync on every build
2. **Use saved exercises** - Users can quickly find their favorites
3. **Filters are powerful** - Combine search + filters for best results
4. **Mobile-friendly** - Grid layout adapts to all screen sizes
